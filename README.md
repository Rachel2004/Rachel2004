# About me 😁

My primary area of interest is creating user-friendly and easily accessible websites. I hold professional certifications in several programming languages, particularly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have a strong passion for front-end development. Additionally, I am also interested in graphic design and have experience with Canva software tools. Painting is another hobby that I enjoy pursuing whenever I'm inspired.
